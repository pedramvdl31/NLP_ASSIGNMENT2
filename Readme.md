In this assignment, I implemented a multiclass clas-sifier using word2vec and a simple convolutional neural network.The   word2vec   model   uses   the   google   pre-trained   word2vecnegative  model.  The  highest  accuracy  was  achieved  after  1000epoch  even  though  after  100  epoch  there  was  only  minimalincrease  in  accuracy  and  other  criteria.  The  highest  accuracyduring  the  training  process  was  82%  (F1  score:  0.8217)  andduring  testing  was  64%  (F1  score:  0.640)
